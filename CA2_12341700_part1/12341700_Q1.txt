before running : 

Total-Time : 2+3+5 = 10
CPU=6.5
CPU utilization : (6.5/10)*100 = 65%

After running : 

Stats: Total Time 15
Stats: CPU Busy 10 (66.67%)
Stats: IO Busy  9 (60.00%)


The total time required for all processes to finish - 15
The CPU utilization percentage - 66.67%

With SWITCH_ON_IO and IO_RUN_LATER, the CPU switches when a process starts I/O, but I/O completion waits until the CPU is free. This can leave the CPU idle when all processes are in I/O, lowering utilization.

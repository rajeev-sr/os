With SWITCH_ON_END, the CPU continues executing a process until it completely finishes, without switching when it starts an I/O operation.
If the running process blocks for I/O, the CPU sits idle even when other processes are ready to run, leading to longer idle periodsâ€”especially for I/O-bound processes that frequently pause.
This approach is inefficient in interactive or multitasking environments, as it delays responsiveness and wastes CPU cycles that could be used to execute other ready tasks.
